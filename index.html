OUR VISION 
Traditionally speaking barbers have always purchased their professional products and services from corporations with creators they have never met or seen. In the last five years there has been an upswing of entrepreneur barbers creating new and innovative products, tools, apparel, videos, apps, and other merchandise. This is the reason Barbersstuff.com was created. Some of the retail power is now in the hands of the artist. For barbers, by barbers. Please support the art of Barbering.   </p>
